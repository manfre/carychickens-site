		<p>We are now accepting applications from Raleigh &amp; Cary chicken owners who wish to be a stop on the 2014 Tour D'Coop on May 17. Homes within the entire City of Raleigh and Town of Cary will be considered for inclusion this year.  <b>Applications are due no later than February 28</b>. <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/about/apply.html">Please fill out the online application</a> and include 3 digital photographs of your coop.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/tickets/">Tickets are on sale now</a> for the 2014 tour. Stay tuned for more information, including sponsorship opportunities. </p>

<p>This unique "Parade of Combs" features hens and coops tucked into the gardens of your friends and neighbors. All tour proceeds benefit <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/urban-ministries/">Urban Ministries of Raleigh</a>. <!-- The 2013 tour is over, but you can learn more about chicken keeping in early June at <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/blog/2013/04/chicken-keeping-101---spring-2013-classes.html">Chicken Keeping 101</a>, a presentation by long-time chicken-keeper Bob Davis. The 2013 tour will be held on Saturday, May 18 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., rain or shine. Tour Tickets are available at the <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/tickets/">following locations</a> on the day of the tour or may be <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/tickets/">purchased here with a credit card</a>.--></p>



<p>The Tour D'Coop is a one-day garden tour in Raleigh, North Carolina, that seeks to educate visitors about keeping hens and delight them with garden ideas and inspiration. Open to adults and children, the tour showcases various hen houses and breeds. Coop owners are on hand at each location to discuss the how-tos of chicken keeping and there are opportunities for photographing and getting to know the chickens. The wide variety of coop styles as well as the surrounding back yard gardens make the tour interesting for the whole family.</p>

<p>Please leave pets and companion animals at home; many hens are not accustomed to dogs.</p>

<p>We encourage tour participants to bring a city map if they do not own a GPS system. The tour tickets only provide the coops' addresses and basic directions. </p>

			<p>We&#8217;ve got a week and a half to go until this year&#8217;s Tour D&#8217;Coop. There are 21 coops on this year&#8217;s tour and this is the first year to include a stop in Cary. <a href="http://bit.ly/11jXuEV">Coop #15</a> is the official Cary Chickens coop. </p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>After more than four years leading the effort to change the Town of Cary&#8217;s chicken ordinances, we finally built a stylish new coop that houses five young &#8216;ladies.&#8217; The hens complement our urban homestead with honeybees, a fruit orchard, strawberry tower and edible plantings.</p>
	</blockquote>

	<p>We&#8217;re excited for the opportunity to be a stop on the tour and help out <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/urban-ministries/">Urban Ministries of Raleigh</a>. Tickets for the tour can be purchased with cash or a non-perishable food donation. <a href="http://www.tourdcoop.com/blog/2013/05/volunteers-needed.html">The Tour organizers are looking for volunteers</a> to help out at the ticket sale locations to help staff the table and collect donated food.

			<p>With the legalization of chickens in Cary, the <a href="http://bit.ly/tourdcoop">Henside the Beltline Tour D&#8217;Coop</a> is accepting applications from chicken owners in Cary that would like to be a stop on the tour for 2013. This year, the tour will be from 10am &#8211; 4pm, Saturday May 18th. If you&#8217;re interested, you can <a href="http://bit.ly/tourdcoop-apply2013">submit an application</a> before February 14th.</p>

	<blockquote>
		<p>Started in 2005 as a way for a few neighbors to show off their hens and coops, the Henside the Beltline Tour D&#8217;Coop has grown to a one-day garden tour that encompasses 20 coops and thousands of visitors. The event raises non-perishable food and money for Urban Ministries, a Raleigh-based non-profit that provides essential services to close to 20,000 Triangle residents each year. Coop owners and the tour organizers volunteer their time to promote back yard poultry and urban farming.</p>

			<p><strong>Correction:</strong> Town managers and town attorney have confirmed that the <span class="caps">LDO</span> language changes were ratified on the council floor. No further council action is needed. Chickens are legal in Cary as of the Aug. 23 vote.</p>

	<p>After more than 4 years of trying, the council members voted to approve the ordinance and legalize backyard chickens! I&#8217;d like to thank everyone who has helped get this ordinance passed. Countless hours were spent collecting signatures, spreading the word, and educating residents at farmer&#8217;s markets and other venues. This was an effort by the community for the benefit of the community.</p>

	<p><strong>Thank You Council and Staff</strong></p>

	<p>We are all very appreciative of the time and effort put forth by all of you in making this ordinance change a reality.</p>

	<p><strong>Details of the ordinance</strong></p>

	<ul>
		<li>Maximum of 5 hens</li>
		<li>No roosters</li>
		<li>Accessory Use Permit required ($50 one time fee)</li>
		<li>No onsite slaughter</li>
		<li>Coop may not be in a front or side yard</li>
		<li>15&#8217; setback</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Please be aware that even though the town now allows backyard chickens, your <span class="caps">HOA</span> may not. If you are interested in getting chickens, check your covenants. Although we are unable to lead any efforts toward changing your covenants, feel free to contact us and we&#8217;ll gladly share ideas and resources that we found to be helpful in our efforts to get this ordinance.</p>

			<p>The chicken ordinance was tabled at the August 9th council meeting. It will be revisited in two weeks, when the new council member will be sworn in.</p>

	<p>We thought we were in the clear, as did Gale, Lori, and Don. We were all blindsided by <a href="http://www.townofcary.org/Town_Council/Cary_Town_Council/councilmembers/robinson.htm">Jennifer Robinson</a> changing her mind about supporting chickens. Jennifer previously voted in favor of chickens during every previous council meeting for the past four years, including the one that sent this very ordinance that she couldn&#8217;t support to planning and zoning.</p>

	<p>Jennifer mentioned that she recently heard more support opposed to chickens and almost none in favor. Clearly, we should not have encouraged everyone to not bug council too much because several council members told us this was a done deal. The 9-0 vote by planning &amp; zoning helped re-enforce the idea that this would pass. We were wrong and need to let her know that we are still here and want legal chickens.</p>

	<p>I encourage you all to contact Cary council member Jennifer Robinson. Let her know that you want her to vote in favor of chickens, and ask her to explain why she would support this issue for four years and unexpectedly oppose it. </p>

	<p>After a unanimous vote (9-0) from the Planning &amp; Zoning committee, the ordinance changes to allow backyard chickens will go before council for (hopefully) a final vote to accept the committee&#8217;s recommendation to approve the ordinance.

	<p>	<ol>
		<li>No slaughtering, instead of ordinance wording that basically stated &#8220;you may slaughter as long as no one can see it&#8221;.</li>

	<p>If you have not done so recently, please email <a href="mailto:council@townofcary.org?subject=Backyard+Chickens">council@townofcary.org</a> and let them know why you want chickens legalized and your thoughts on the proposed ordinance. </p>

	<ul>
		<li>Are you happy with the 6 hen limit?</li>
		<li>Do you understand the proposed setback rules? If not, let them know if it is confusing and that you want an easy to follow rule (e.g. 8&#8217; from all property lines, which is the minimum set back for the various zonings, assuming I understand it correctly).</li>
		<li>How do you feel about the $50 one time fee (yearly fee appears to have been dropped)?</li>
	</ul>

	<p>If you are on friendly terms with your neighbors, it will be very helpful if you can convince them to email council and let them know that they even though they do not plan on getting chickens, they have no objections if their neighbors do.</p>
